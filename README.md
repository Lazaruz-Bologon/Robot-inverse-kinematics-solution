# Robot-inverse-kinematics-solution
The code is used to solve the forward kinematics and inverse kinematics of the six-axis manipulator
The Test1 file is used to solve the forward kinematics of the six-axis robot arm, the Test2 file is used to solve the inverse kinematics of the six-axis robot arm, and the main file is used to input parameters. The parameters in each file can be modified according to realistic data, and the parameters in the code are derived from the data of the network robot arm
